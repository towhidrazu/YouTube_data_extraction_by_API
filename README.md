2.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore patterns, trends, and insights within the data.
4.	Trend and Performance Analysis: Analyzing user engagement, content performance, and trends on the platform.
5.	Visualization: Creating comprehensive visualizations to present findings effectively.
